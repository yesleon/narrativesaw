# narrativesaw

## A hypertext mirror of my thoughts

The world consists of multiple narratives. As a life, I have the responsibility to interpret the narratives around me.

## Contents

There are two ways of organizing articles. One is categorization, and the other is tagging. I usually use these two methods simultaneously, however since this site is static, I can only replace the tagging system with a collection system not unlike the albums in Apple's Photos app.

### Categories

- Essays
- Short Stories
- Tutorials
- Notes

### Collections

- iOS Development
