		<p>The world consists of multiple narratives. As a life, I have the responsibility of interpreting the narratives around me.</p>

		<h2>Contents</h2>
		<p>There are two ways of organizing articles: <a href="categories-versus-tags.html">categories and tags</a>. I usually use both of them simultaneously, however since this site is static, I have to replace the tagging system with a collection system, which is not unlike the albums in Apple's Photos app.</p>

		<h3 id="section-categories">Categories</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Essays</li>
			<li>Short Stories</li>
			<li>Tutorials</li>
			<li>Notes</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 id="section-collections">Collections</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>iOS Development</li>

		</ul>
