<p>The world is a narrative, and I am going to saw it up.</p>

<h2>Contents</h2>
<p>There are two ways of organizing articles. One is categorization, and the other is tagging. I usually use these two methods simultaneously, however since this site is static, I can only replace the tagging system with a collection system not unlike the albums in Apple's Photos app.</p>

<h3>Categories</h3>
<ul>
<li>Essays</li>
<li>Short Stories</li>
<li>Tutorials</li>
<li>Notes</li>
</ul>

<h3>Collections</h3>
<ul>
<li>iOS Development</li>

</ul>
